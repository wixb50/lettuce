Tool comparisons

This is not the first time I have written a tool for
behaviour-driven development. I worked on Pyccuracy_ which is an
awesome tool for testing websites.

As expected I am a hard user of Pyccuracy_, but since I met
Cucumber_, I fell in love with Scenario Outlines, global variables and
tables.  Although Pyccuracy_ does not aim to do the same as Cucumber_
does, sometimes it sucks, because Cucumber has very handy features that
avoid code duplication and so on.

Thus, Lettuce does not aim solely at automated website testing. Lettuce
is a multi-purpose testing tool.
